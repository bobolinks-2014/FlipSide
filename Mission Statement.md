Mission Statement:
We are going to build an anti-echo chamber. Our app will break through the information cocoon that most people live in, providing them with viewpoints that don't just mirror their existing beliefs. We believe that modern political discourse is broken, so we are here to disrupt the news world.

Visions:
- Classic news feed, similar to FB, infinite scrolling, shows you things you like, this lets you rate what you read (1 to 5? - did you agree and feel it was worthwhile, two scales: was it good, did you agree with it), you are shown things that don't correspond with things you like
- Taggable so that you can classify what you read
- Learn about user through ratings
- Possible language analysis
- Possible RSS integration
- Link externally or display internally?
- Research algorithms that do the opposite of what we're doing
- Limited to user data makes it easier for us to find opposites and make article predictions
- Start with feed of articles and have users rate them, different opinions
- What users see is user driven, what news gets fed in is curated by devs
- Use readme to explain methodologies:

- MVP by Sunday morning
- Primarily a single page app
- crowdsourcing the article ratings

- get seed data on user reading habits. 


Stretches:
- Google Chrome Extension
- User stats
- Saving articles
- Search
- Plot articles on political compass

Schedule:
- Stop working at 12 PM
- Standups at 8 AM, 1 PM, 4:30 PM (emotional check-in along with code check-in), when first person leaves
- Standup schedule:
	- What you've done, what you're about to do, specific problems, update Trello
	- 15-20 min., ~3 min. per person

Team Dynamics:
- Pairing: 
	- Depends on how we break up work
	- Cycle pairs frequently
	- One person writes code, other writes test for that code, go back and forth
	- One pair write test skeletons, the other pair writes code
- Conflict resolution:
	- Generally try to go democratic
	- Timebox resolutions

Testing:
- TDD as much as possible

Beers:
- Bud Light

Git Workflow:
- Super frequent commits, infrequent pushes
- Clean branches at the end of the day
- Peer-reviewed (group?) pushes
- Good coding practices, no working on the same file

Communication Tools:
- Test Coverage: SimpleCov
- CI Agent: Travis
- Communication Tools: HipChat, Trello
- Group together for models, migrations, routes
